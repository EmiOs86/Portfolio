          I’m Emi Osborn, I'm a biz & tech mastery coach. My magic is to help moms build a profitable & authentic digital business fast. We focus on clarity, aligned marketing plans, zero tech headaches, and turning that 1% misalignment into 100% aligned actions. You will build wealth and enjoy your dream life with deep purpose, fulfillment & freedom.
          <br />
          <br />
          I’ve been a serial entrepreneur for more than a decade. For most people, the technology sounds very complicated and time-consuming. For me, making tech fun, easy, and pretty is a passion. After being a website & funnel builder for few years, I realized most entrepreneurs are jumping into tech way too quick before they even establish a strong and clear business foundation. That’s why I spent a year to become a mastery method certified life coach, to be able to help you on a deeper level to activate your full potential.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the years, I’ve developed my magical E.M.I. Remedy. E stands for "Effortless" - I'll help you build a solid business foundation effortlessly with ease. M stands for "Magnetic" - I’ll help you create a unique marketing plan that’s so magnetically attractive. And I stands for "Inspired" - every step you take for your business will be aligned with your vision, so you'll feel inspired every step of the way.
