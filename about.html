          Emi Osborn was born and raised in Beijing, China. She finished collage
          with an Industrial Design degree (also self studied interior design)
          and after that, she was lost. She spent a year to figure out what she
          really wanted, she even learnt Italian at one point because she
          thought getting into fashion buying in Italy is cool (Okay it still
          sounds cool!)
          <br />
          <br />
          At the end she moved to Los Angeles to pursue her fashion design
          dream. She went to FIDM, after years of fashion design experiences,
          Emi started a doggie clothing brand “Le Petit Fluffy” in 2016. In
          early 2018, Emi has this idea to have a place full of joy to delight &
          inspire young women, and simplify their busy life. Le Petit Remedy was
          launched with this idea in mind.
          <br />
          <br />
          For the past several years, Emi has been all over the place on her
          solopreneur journey. She tried so many thing: physical products, drop
          ship, print on demand, MLM etc. After years of trying, Emi finally
          realize she only interested in design branding for her new biz, build
          websites and that’s her super power! Most female solopreneurs are not
          tech savvy, where Emi’s super power comes in handy! Emi finally found
          her purpose after years: Help female solopreneurs start their side
          hustle with zero design & tech headache.
